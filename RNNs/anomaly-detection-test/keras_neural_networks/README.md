RNN- Recurrent Neural Networks
LSTM- Long Short Term Memory

Recurrent Neural Networks
- are especially useful for sequential data because each neuron or unit can use its internal memory to maintain
information about the previous inputs.

LSTM networks:
- A special kind of RNNs, capable of learning long term dependecies.
